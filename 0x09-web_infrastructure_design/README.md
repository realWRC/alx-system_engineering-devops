###0x09-web_infrastructure_design

This project was meant to each learners the general overview of how web infrastructure
works. We were instructed to whiteboard three versions of web infrastructure and describe
aspects about the various components.

The whiteboards are embedded in markdown pages with the respective names of the whiteboards
from the intranet. All whiteboards were done on [draw.io](drawio.com).
